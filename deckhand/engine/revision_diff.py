def revision_diff(revision_id, comparison_revision_id, deepdiff=False):
    """Generate the diff between two revisions.

    Generate the diff between the two revisions: `revision_id` and
    `comparison_revision_id`.
    a. When deepdiff=False: A basic comparison of the revisions in terms of
    how the buckets involved have changed is generated. Only buckets with
    existing documents in either of the two revisions in question will be
    reported.
    b. When deepdiff=True: Along with basic comparision, It will generate deep
    diff between revisions' modified buckets.

    Only in case of diff, The ordering of the two revision IDs is
    interchangeable, i.e. no matter the order, the same result is generated.

    The differences include:

        - "created": A bucket has been created between the revisions.
        - "deleted": A bucket has been deleted between the revisions.
        - "modified": A bucket has been modified between the revisions.
                      When deepdiff is enabled, It also includes deep
                      difference between the revisions.
        - "unmodified": A bucket remains unmodified between the revisions.

    :param revision_id: ID of the first revision.
    :param comparison_revision_id: ID of the second revision.
    :param deepdiff: Whether deepdiff needed or not.
    :returns: A dictionary, keyed with the bucket IDs, containing any of the
        differences enumerated above.

    Examples Diff::
