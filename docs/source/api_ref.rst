Deckhand API Documentation
==========================

API
---

This API will only support YAML as a serialization format. Since the IETF
does not provide an official media type for YAML, this API will use
``application/x-yaml``.

This is a description of the ``v1.0`` API. Documented paths are considered
relative to ``/api/v1.0``.

PUT ``/buckets/{bucket_name}/documents``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Accepts a multi-document YAML body and creates a new revision that updates the
contents of the ``bucket_name`` bucket.  Documents from the specified bucket that
exist in previous revisions, but are absent from the request are removed from
that revision (though still accessible via older revisions).

Documents in other buckets are not changed and will be included in queries for
documents of the newly created revision.

Updates are detected based on exact match to an existing document of ``schema`` +
``metadata.name``.  It is an error that responds with ``409 Conflict`` to attempt
to PUT a document with the same ``schema`` + ``metadata.name`` as an existing
document from a different bucket in the most-recent revision.

This endpoint is the only way to add, update, and delete documents. This
triggers Deckhand's internal schema validations for all documents.

If no changes are detected, a new revision should not be created. This allows
services to periodically re-register their schemas without creating
unnecessary revisions.

GET ``/revisions/{revision_id}/documents``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns a multi-document YAML response containing all the documents matching
the filters specified via query string parameters. Returned documents will be
as originally added with no substitutions or layering applied.

Supported query string parameters:

* ``schema`` - string, optional - The top-level ``schema`` field to select. This
  may be partially specified by section, e.g., ``schema=promenade`` would select all
  ``kind`` and ``version`` schemas owned by promenade, or ``schema=promenade/Node``
  which would select all versions of ``promenade/Node`` documents. One may not
  partially specify the namespace or kind, so ``schema=promenade/No`` would not
  select ``promenade/Node/v1`` documents, and ``schema=prom`` would not select
  ``promenade`` documents.
* ``metadata.name`` - string, optional
* ``metadata.layeringDefinition.abstract`` - string, optional - Valid values are
  the "true" and "false".
* ``metadata.layeringDefinition.layer`` - string, optional - Only return documents from
  the specified layer.
* ``metadata.label`` - string, optional, repeatable - Uses the format
  ``metadata.label=key=value``. Repeating this parameter indicates all
  requested labels must apply (AND not OR).
* ``status.bucket`` - string, optional, repeatable - Used to select documents
  only from a particular bucket.  Repeating this parameter indicates documents
  from any of the specified buckets should be returned.
* ``sort`` - string, optional, repeatable - Defines the sort order for returning
  results.  Default is by creation date.  Repeating this parameter indicates use
  of multi-column sort with the most significant sorting column applied first.
* ``order`` - string, optional - Valid values are "asc" and "desc". Default is
  "asc". Controls the order in which the ``sort`` result is returned: "asc"
  returns sorted results in ascending order, while "desc" returns results in
  descending order.

GET ``/revisions/{revision_id}/rendered-documents``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns a multi-document YAML of fully layered and substituted documents. No
abstract documents will be returned. This is the primary endpoint that
consumers will interact with for their configuration.

Valid query parameters are the same as for
``/revisions/{revision_id}/documents``, minus the parameters in
``metadata.layeringDetinition``, which are not supported.

Raises a ``409 Conflict`` if a ``layeringPolicy`` document could not be found.

Raises a ``500 Internal Server Error`` if rendered documents fail schema
validation.

GET ``/revisions``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lists existing revisions and reports basic details including a summary of
validation status for each ``deckhand/ValidationPolicy`` that is part of that
revision.

Supported query string parameters:

* ``tag`` - string, optional, repeatable - Used to select revisions that have
  been tagged with particular tags.
* ``sort`` - string, optional, repeatable - Defines the sort order for returning
  results.  Default is by creation date.  Repeating this parameter indicates use
  of multi-column sort with the most significant sorting column applied first.
* ``order`` - string, optional - Valid values are "asc" and "desc". Default is
  "asc". Controls the order in which the ``sort`` result is returned: "asc"
  returns sorted results in ascending order, while "desc" returns results in
  descending order.

DELETE ``/revisions``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Permanently delete all documents.

.. warning::

  This removes all revisions and resets the data store.

GET ``/revisions/{{revision_id}}``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get a detailed description of a particular revision. The status of each
``ValidationPolicy`` belonging to the revision is also included. Valid values
for the status of each validation policy are:

* ``success`` - All validations associated with the policy are ``success``.
* ``failure`` - Any validation associated with the policy has status ``failure``,
  ``expired`` or ``missing``.

        - name: armada-deployability-validation
          url: https://deckhand/api/v1.0/revisions/1/validations/armada-deployability-validation/entries/0
          status: failure

Validation status is always for the most recent entry for a given validation.
A status of ``missing`` indicates that no entries have been created. A status
of ``expired`` indicates that the validation had succeeded, but the
``expiresAfter`` limit specified in the ``ValidationPolicy`` has been exceeded.

GET ``/revisions/{{revision_id}}/diff/{{comparison_revision_id}}``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This endpoint provides a basic comparison of revisions in terms of how the
buckets involved have changed.  Only buckets with existing documents in either
of the two revisions in question will be reported; buckets with documents that
are only present in revisions between the two being compared are omitted from
this report. That is, buckets with documents that were accidentally created
(and then deleted to rectify the mistake) that are not directly present in
the two revisions being compared are omitted.

The response will contain a status of ``created``, ``deleted``, ``modified``, or
``unmodified`` for each bucket.

The ordering of the two revision ids is not important.

For the purposes of diffing, the ``revision_id`` "0" is treated as a revision
with no documents, so queries comparing revision "0" to any other revision will
report "created" for each bucket in the compared revision.

Diffing a revision against itself will respond with the each of the buckets in
the revision as ``unmodified``.

Diffing revision "0" against itself results in an empty dictionary as the response.
