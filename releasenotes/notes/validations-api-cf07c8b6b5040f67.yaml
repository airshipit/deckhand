    The Validations API has been introduced to Deckhand, allowing users
    to register new validation results in Deckhand, as well as query
    the API for validation results for a revision. The validation results
    include a list of errors that occurred during document validation.

    The following endpoints have been implemented:

        * /api/v1.0/revisions/{revision_id}/validations
        * /api/v1.0/revisions/{revision_id}/validations/{validation_name}
        * /api/v1.0/revisions/{revision_id}/validations/{validation_name}/entries
        * /api/v1.0/revisions/{revision_id}/validations/{validation_name}/entries/{entry_id}
