    Development mode has been added to Deckhand, allowing for the possibility
    of running Deckhand without Keystone. A new paste file has been added
    to ``etc/deckhand`` called ``noauth-paste.ini`` which excludes Keystone
    authentication. To run Deckhand in development mode, set development_mode
    as True in deckhand.conf. Note that Deckhand will expect to find
    ``noauth-paste.ini`` on the host with development_mode set as True in
    etc/deckhand/deckhand.conf.sample.
