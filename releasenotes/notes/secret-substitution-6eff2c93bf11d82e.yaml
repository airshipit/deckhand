    Deckhand now supports secret substitution for documents. The endpoint
    ``GET revisions/{revision_id}/rendered-documents`` has been added to
    Deckhand, which allows the possibility of listing fully substituted
    documents. Only documents with ``metadata.substitutions`` field undergo
    secret substitution dynamically.
